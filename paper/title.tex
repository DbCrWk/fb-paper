\begin{abstract}

We devised the ``ISTK'' model to approximate the spread of viral information---a \textit{rumor}---through a given (social) network.
For our first version of the model, we used a set of ordinary differential equations to assess the spread of a rumor in face-to-face interactions in a homogenous population.
Our second model translated this system into an equivalent stochastic agent-based model, but also incorporates a network that encodes the relationship between individuals.
Our third model considered \textit{features}: demographic information that characterized individuals in our representative population.
We also generated a feature vector for the rumor in order to simulate its ``personality,'' which further affected its spread.
Our results showed that incorporating the structure of a network alters the dynamics of a rumor's spread, but preserves steady states.
However, the addition of a feature vector prevents the rumor from saturating the network, and the similarity of a rumor with the population further affects its spread.
This final agent-based, feature-vector ISTK model provides a more realistic mechanism to account for social behaviors, thus permitting more precise study of the dynamics of rumor spread through networks.
