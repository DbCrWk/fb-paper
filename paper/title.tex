\begin{abstract}

We constructed the ``ISTK'' model to approximate the spread of viral information, a \textit{rumor}, through a given (social) network.
Initially, we used a set of ordinary differential equations to assess the spread of a rumor in face-to-face interactions in a homogenous population.
Our next model translated this system into an equivalent stochastic agent-based model.
We then incorporated a network based off of a representative Facebook dataset.
Our last model considered \textit{features}: demographic information that characterized individuals in our representative population.
We also generated a feature vector for the rumor in order to simulate its ``personality.''
An increase in the average similarity of the rumor to the population resulted in increased propagation through the network.
Our results showed that incorporating the structure of a network alters the behavior of the rumor as it spreads across the population, while preserving the steady-states.
However, the addition of feature vectors prevents the rumor from saturating the network.
Our agent-based, feature-equipped ISTK model provides a more realistic mechanism to account for social behaviors, thus allowing for a more precise model of the dynamics of rumor spread through networks.
