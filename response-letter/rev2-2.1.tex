what does ``ran the differential model'' mean in the ﬁrst sentence?
Also, is this the ISTK model or something else?
You say ``differential model'' throughout the paper.
If this is the ISTK model, use that terminology.
I think it's clearer.

We changed the inappropriate phrasing ``ran the differential model'' to ``we solved the differential model.''
We agree that our terminology was loose when referring to the models.
Throughout the paper, we enforced consistent terminology for the three equations: differential model; simple, agent-based model; and feature-vector, agent-based model.
At times, we also omit the ``agent-based'' term when discussing the ``simple'' and ``feature-vector'' model when we feel the context is sufficiently clear.
We have also clarified that all three models are versions of the ISTK model.

\textbf{Comment \arabic{rev2-2.1}} \\
You are talking about comparing to a stochastic agent-based model, which is below this in the paper.
It's confusing in this order.
(After a reread, I understand what you are saying but I’m not sure you need to mention it yet until you do a comparison).

\textbf{Response \arabic{rev2-2.1}} \\
This confusing part was removed.
