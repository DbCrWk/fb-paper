\textbf{Comment \arabic{rev2-3.2}} \\
Again, as in 3.1, a reference for this would be helpful.

\textbf{Response \arabic{rev2-3.2}} \\
We believe that our added reference (Reference 23, ``T. A. Snijders'') in Section 3.1 suffices.

\textbf{Comment \arabic{rev2-3.2}} \\
It appears that your agents and rumors have dimension 195 and you list some of them.
I can understand some of those features being common to both (like language, in which it is interpreted differently: for the agent, can the person speak language X and for the rumor, is it written in language X), but most don't appear to be relevant to one or the other.

\textbf{Response \arabic{rev2-3.2}} \\
We assume that a rumor can be targeted towards a particular demographic.
The particular features selected, while roughly representative of real demographic information, introduce a mechanism to consider targeting rumors within the context of a (social) network.
We do not claim that we are precisely modeling particular rumors and their appeal across certain demographics; instead, more generally, we demosntrate that it is in fact possible to model a targeted rumor.
We have added a few sentences to clarify this point.

\textbf{Comment \arabic{rev2-3.2}} \\
Again, you mention at the bottom of the section that you ran 300 trials.
It's not very clear what this means.

\textbf{Response \arabic{rev2-3.2}} \\
We greatly clarified this in the beginning of Section 3.1.
