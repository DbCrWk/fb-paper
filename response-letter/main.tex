\opening{To Professor\ Carter:}

Herewith we re-submit our revised paper ``Rumors with Personality: A Differential and Agent-Based Model of Information Spread through Networks'' by Devavrat V. Dabke and Eva E. Arroyo.
Thank you for your suggestions, we have revised our draft accordingly.

We include the same three models as in the previous draft but with clarifications on their similarities and differences, as well as the parameter choice that we used for each.
Because of the confusion introduction to our model itself---originally just a set of four equations---we have included a new flow chart, which we feel greatly clarifies the way in which populations move within our model.
In addition, the conclusion includes more discussion of how individual feature vectors relate to the spread of the rumor throughout the population.
Several figures have also been changed to increase clarity.

Below, we provide reference to areas we corrected for each comment we received.
In a few cases where the recommended change was not made exactly as the reviewer suggested,\ we provide reasoning and clarification.
We appreciate your feedback, which we feel has much improved our manuscript.


We greatly appreciate your consideration of our submission
\vspace{24pt}
\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
