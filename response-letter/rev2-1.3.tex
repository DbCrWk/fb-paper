\textbf{Comment \arabic{rev2-1.3}} \\
Itâ€™s a little awkward starting a section with equations. How about: ``The equations that describe the ISTK model are:''

This section was entirely revamped for clarity, and includes this change.

\textbf{Comment \arabic{rev2-1.3}} \\
Overall in this section, I find it difficult to follow.
Is any possible way of simplifying the explanation?
A possible way to accomplish this is to list all of the terms on the right sides of the equations (without signs) and explain them.
For example, the terms all either interaction terms (the products of two individuals) or the term $ S/d $.
After explaining the interactions, the equations could then be more easily understood.

This section has two major changes to address this concern:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We added a flow chart to provide a powerful visual representation of our equations.
    We believe this greatly clarifies the way in which an individual can move from one population the next.
    \item Instead of a block of four equations, we separated them out and provided their corresponding explanations directly below each one.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Comment \arabic{rev2-1.3}} \\
It would be helpful and quite relevant to explain the differences with these equations and those from the Daley-Kendal model.

\textbf{Response \arabic{rev2-1.3}} \\
We have added a paragraph to the end of this section to address this concern.

\textbf{Comment \arabic{rev2-1.3}} \\
Equation (1) seems to simplify to $ dI/dt = -c(ell) S I $.
Perhaps a comment of why you don't do this.

\textbf{Response \arabic{rev2-1.3}} \\
We added a comment in the paragraph directly below this equation to address this concern.
