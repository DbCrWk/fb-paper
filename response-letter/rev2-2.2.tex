\textbf{Comment \arabic{rev2-2.2}} \\
Overall, it seems that you are estimating the parameters on the right side of equations (1)--(4).
You mention $ c $ and then tau [$ \tau $] (which is not one of the parameters in (1)--(4) ) and say something about $ ell $, but not specify it.
There are also alpha [$ \alpha $] terms and $ d $.
What about these?
It appears from your results that you vary these, but you should say something about them here.

\textbf{Response \arabic{rev2-2.2}} \\
We have restructured the equations section (Section 1.3) to address this.
We have additionally clarified this through Section 2.2.2 on estimating parameters in the differential model.
