\textbf{Comment \arabic{rev2-results-discussion}} \\
You should list exactly what parameters you used to produce the plot in Figure 1.
It would be nice to try to reproduce this, but I can't without the exact parameters.

\textbf{Response \arabic{rev2-results-discussion}} \\
Section 2.2.2 provides parameters for the differential model.
This should be enough to reproduce our results.

Figure 3: you have a disconnect between the legend and the vertical axis.
Is it 25\% or 50\%?

\textbf{Response \arabic{rev2-results-discussion}} \\
This is corrected. The legend and axis now read 50\%.

\textbf{Comment \arabic{rev2-results-discussion}} \\
A bit confused about this also.
The steady state ISTK model for each of the 4 values are single numbers (unless you varied the parameters).
What exactly does the difference plot show?
Is it just the data from the agent-based model minus the steady state and then produced as a plot?

\textbf{Response \arabic{rev2-results-discussion}} \\
Yes, this is clarified in the caption and text that follows this figure.

\textbf{Comment \arabic{rev2-results-discussion}} \\
I think it would be nice to have a plot that directly compares Figure 1 with Figure 5.
This seems like a natural comparison to do.

\textbf{Response \arabic{rev2-results-discussion}} \\
This is what Figure 6 attempts to accomplish, and so we have added some sentences to highlight that this is a comparison of Figures 1 and 5.

\textbf{Comment \arabic{rev2-results-discussion}} \\
Again, it appears that Figure 7 shows for the feature-vector model the same plot as figures 1 and 5. This isn't pointed out clearly.

\textbf{Response \arabic{rev2-results-discussion}} \\
A sentence has been added to the description of Figure 7 to underscore this fact.

\textbf{Comment \arabic{rev2-results-discussion}} \\
It appears from the discussion that the feature vector may not accurately model real-world (or at least it is not consistent with the other two models).
Other than the fact that the authors studied this, is this necessary in the paper?
I argue that there is too much in this paper already, perhaps remove this model and stress the similarities of the other two.

\textbf{Response \arabic{rev2-results-discussion}} \\
We have considered this and conclude that our entire paper leads toward the feature-vector model.
We would like to stress that the feature-vector, agent-based model is the most interesting one, and it builds directly off of the simple, agent-based model by adding the concept of a rumor's ``personality.''
Furthermore, the simple, agent-based model builds off of the differential model by incorporating a network, instead of using a homogenous population.
For these reasons, we believe that the main intrigue of the paper rests with the feature-vector model, and we wish to continue to include it.
