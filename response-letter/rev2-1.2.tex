\textbf{Comment \arabic{rev2-1.2}} \\
Often language is used about the personality of the rumor, when I think it the personality of the individual instead.

\textbf{Response \arabic{rev2-1.2}} \\
In the feature-vector, agent-based model, we equip rumors with a feature vector.
This feature vector parallels the demographics (encoded as vectors) for each agent in the model.
Therefore, we define this feature vector as the ``personality'' of the rumor.
The rationale behind this name was two-fold: we believe that it provides a succint link from the feature vector of the rumor to the corresponding characteristic vector of the agents; we also believe that this term incites intrigue and colorfully illustrates the importance and dynamism of the rumor.
The ``personality'' of the rumor is our term for its characteristic feature vector.
We kept the terms and clarified its first usage in this paper, which is in this section, in the second paragraph.
