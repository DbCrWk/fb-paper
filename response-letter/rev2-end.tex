\subsection{Final Comments}

\textbf{Comment} \\
Another big question that I have is that one item from the introduction that appears important from their point of view is that the authors have included another another term from the Daley-Kendal model.
This was explained in section 2.1.
This is mentioned, but no comparison to the original (IST) model is explained. Has this been done already?
If so, reference it and if not, an explanation is warranted.
