\subsection{Final Comments}

\textbf{Comment} \\
Another big question that I have is that one item from the introduction that appears important from their point of view is that the authors have included another another term from the Daley-Kendall model.
This was explained in section 2.1.
This is mentioned, but no comparison to the original (IST) model is explained. Has this been done already?
If so, reference it and if not, an explanation is warranted.

\textbf{Response} \\
We have added more detail on how and why we diverged from the IST model.
In conjunction with our references to other explorations of rumor spread, we believe that we now sufficiently address not only how our model differs from the Daley-Kendall (DK) one, but also why we differ from their model.
